Quick Start
-----------
1. Once you have the binary - called xppaut - test it by going into
   the directory odes/ and typing

       ../xppaut pend.ode

   The file should load up and you can begin to explore it.

2. Once it has fired up, click on Window and select Zoom In. Then click
   the mouse inside the main window and holding down the button, drag it
   on the screen. You should see a rectangle that stretches as you move
   the mouse. If you do not see this then you should run the program with
   the -xorfix command line:

       ../xppaut -xorfix lecar.ode

3. Repeat the above and you should see the box.

4. There are additional help files in help/.
